        "bot": "Assignment 1 requires you to build an AI-enabled app functioning as a University Professor\u2019s Personal Knowledge Advantage Machine (p-KaM).  Focus on either *Teaching* or *Research* tasks, not Service.\n\nHere's a breakdown:\n\n**Goal:**  Improve a professor's productivity in either teaching or research by creating a p-KaM.\n\n**Focus Areas (Choose One):**\n\n* **Teaching:** This could involve tasks like updating lecture materials, ensuring accuracy and current information, and identifying potentially irresponsible or unsafe content.  Think about how AI could help a professor stay up-to-date in their field and prepare engaging and relevant lectures.\n* **Research:** This could involve tasks like literature review, grant proposal writing, data analysis, or manuscript preparation.  Consider how AI could assist with finding relevant research, managing citations, or even generating reports.\n\n**Key Components of Your p-KaM:**\n\n1. **Interface/Prompts:** Your p-KaM needs a way for the professor to interact with it. This could be through text, audio, image, or video input.  You could also design it to operate in an autonomous mode, proactively performing tasks.\n\n2. **Local Knowledge Base:** This is a repository of information specific to the professor, such as their own publications, lecture notes, or research data.  This allows the p-KaM to personalize its assistance.\n\n3. **Global Knowledge Base:**  This connects to external resources like online databases, research journals, or news feeds. This ensures the p-KaM has access to the latest information in the chosen field.\n\n4. **Development Platform:** You'll need to choose a platform to build your p-KaM on.  This will depend on your group's skills and the specific functionalities you're aiming for.\n\n**Deliverables:**\n\n* **Functional p-KaM App:** The core deliverable is a working application demonstrating the chosen functionalities.\n* **Expo Presentation:** You will present your project in an expo format at the end of the semester, including a demonstration of your p-KaM.  Prepare for peer feedback and evaluation.\n* **Demo Video:**  A video of your demo should be submitted to the archival folder on eCampus, and the link submitted on eCampus.\n\n**Presentation Details:**  Your expo presentation should include:\n\n1. **Problem Statement (1 slide):** Briefly explain the problem your p-KaM addresses.\n2. **Technologies Used (1 slide):** List the technologies used in building your app.\n3. **Architecture Schematic (1 slide):**  A visual representation of your p-KaM's architecture.\n4. **Feature Demonstration:** Showcase the completed and demonstrable features of your p-KaM.\n5. **Live Demonstration:** A live demonstration of your system in action.\n\n**Grading:** This assignment is worth 50% of your final grade.  Peer evaluation through anonymous feedback during the expo will be a significant component of the grade.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n\n* **Q&A Sessions:**  The assignment will be discussed in more detail during Q&A sessions in class. Attend these sessions to clarify any doubts.\n* **Contemporary References:**  Refer to the provided resources on eCampus for inspiration and guidance.  These include information on building apps, AI ethics, and AI safety.\n* **Group Work:**  Utilize the group features on eCampus for collaboration, file sharing, discussions, task division, and communication.\n\n\nRemember to choose a specific area of focus (teaching or research) and clearly define the functionalities of your p-KaM.  Good luck!\n"
